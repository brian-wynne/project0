            Hello, my name is Brian Wynne. I am 27 years old and have been working on creating a Website for the company
            I currently work for. I am taking this course to get a better grasp on web design. Most projects that I have worked
            on consisted of back-end programming so styling and organizing UI is very new for me. Thank you for teaching me!
