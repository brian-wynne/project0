            <span class="ancient-aliens">Ancient Aliens</span> is an American television series that premiered on April 20, 2010, on the History channel.[1] Produced by Prometheus Entertainment in a documentary style, the program presents hypotheses of ancient astronauts and proposes that historical texts, 
            archaeology, and legends contain evidence of past human-extraterrestrial contact.[2][3] The show has been widely criticized by historians, cosmologists, archaeologists and other scientific circles for presenting and promoting pseudoscience, pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology.
            The series started with a TV special of the same name that aired on March 8, 2009, on the History channel. Seasons 1â€“3 aired on the same channel until 2011. From season 4 to the middle of season 7, the series aired on H2. On April 10, 2015, episode premieres returned to History channel.
